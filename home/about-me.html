          <h1>Aspirations and I</h1>
     <p>I am Muhammad Radif Hassan, born and grew up in Phulpur Upazila of Mymensingh district. As a child, I was quite indomitable and very social. My ABC of education was guided by my parents. I started my education at a local kindergarten known as Phulpur Kindergarten School. I studied there from playgroup to 1st grade. At that time, I loved drawing and playing a lot! I played many games with friends my age and those slightly older or younger. We played <i>Kanamachi</i>,<i>Elunti</i>,<i>London</i>,<i>Kutkut</i>,<i>Bowchi</i> and <i>Hadudu</i>, with boys and girls together. Those were truly memorable and nostalgic moments for me, and these are the most notable games I played with them.
I still try to remember those golden days when I rode a piece of wood attached to three bearings, making it look like a rickshaw. Someone would pull me from behind, and off I went. Sometimes, I fell on the road and got injured. When I came back home, my mother scolded me for getting hurt—like pouring water on a drowned mouse. I was very fond of Tollywood actor Dev. I never missed his songs and movies and used to imitate his running style whenever I ran. I had a tendency to snap at everything. Moreover, I had many friends who made my childhood even more glorious and lively.</p>
<p>In second grade, I moved to Dhaka. It was a really challenging situation for me because I had to leave my friends from Phulpur, and it was very hard for me to adapt to the new environment. My father enrolled me in a local primary school named Dakshin Muhsendi Government Primary School for second grade. At first, I felt a bit nervous about making new friends, but eventually, I managed to adjust. I made many friends. I still remember walking with a girl on the playground, and suddenly, she gave me a diary. My mother saw it, but she didn’t say anything. It was really a hilarious incident for me. Especially at that time for my age.<br>
Later, I left that school and got admitted to Dhaka Collegiate School in third grade, competing among 5,000 students. I placed 15th on the merit list for the day shift. Once again, I had to get used to a new environment and make new friends. I met many great people there, including some of my best friends. I really miss those days—they are my golden memories of life in Dhaka.</p>

<p>After completing fifth grade, my family moved back to Mymensingh city. My father's dream was to get me into a cadet college, but the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted my studies. From sixth to eighth grade, I attended a local high school called Gohailkandi High School. I always earned the love of my teachers in every school, and this time was no exception. I have some irritating memories here as well. I was teased by some girls, which we could call "Adam Teasing." I met some true friends who really loved and respected me. I don’t know why, but they truly supported me in adapting to this school. In mid-2022, due to some conspiracies by mischievous boys, I transferred to Progressive School, where I am currently studying. I will be sitting for the SSC examination in 2025 from this school. My entrance of this school was very sorrowful. I entered as a last boy from a first boy. I made friendships with both good and bad boys at this school. Unfortunately, I was influenced by the bad boys and absorbed their negative behaviors and attitudes. After failing the half-yearly exam, my subconscious mind realized that I should not live that way, but I couldn’t control myself. Nonetheless, I passed class 8 and placed 78th out of 289. This time, I truly brought change into myself. This time, I met some cool boys and discovered that I was also a student just like them, as I had been before. But why had I become this way? I formed friendships with them and was positively influenced by them to bring back my old version. And yes, I was able to do that successfully. I’m really thankful to those people who played a great role in my transformation.</p>

<p>I have always loved thinking deeply and exploring various subjects. Between fourth and fifth grade, I developed a keen interest in Abrahamic religions. I also enjoy reading books and novels. During seventh grade, I entered puberty, which turned my life upside down for a while; however, I quickly adapted. My habit of exploration increased, and I learned how to solve a Rubik's Cube, eventually getting into speedcubing. I then started joining some Facebook groups about science, which further influenced my interest. I began exploring higher-level topics such as relativity, string theory, black holes, and cosmology. I have always been very imaginative, and my love for science blossomed during this period, keeping me away from all negativity throughout ninth grade. This passion has only grown and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>Recently, I have also started exploring computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, and robotics from the ground up. In my free time, I love solving problems through programming. I also enjoy solving problems related to the Mathematics and Physics Olympiads, which brings me immense joy. Solving complex problems by applying mathematical concepts gives me unparalleled satisfaction. From this, I have loved to think logically and love logic. I am very interested in various Olympiads as well as astronomy, astrophysics, and competitive programming contests. Additionally, I sometimes write about my recent stories, articles, or other content. So, that was my introduction.</p>
