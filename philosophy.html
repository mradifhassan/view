  <p>If I ask you, what is philosophy? What would be your answer to say? I know different types of people have different opinion in this regard. I'm also one of them who has a different answer. Well, I have thought this question's answer for a long time but couldn't figured out but at last I have figured out this stuff.
<br><br>
Well, philosophy is not only a hypothetical thoughts but also an approach trying to understand the basic principle of things and beings around us. at least it has seemed to me for the definition of philosophy. I don't know how people will treat this definition all though this is completely my personal opinion.
<br><br>
Now I am going to provide and explain two core concepts that I mentioned in the definition.
</p>
<p class="point">Hypothetical thoughts </p>
<p class="point">Enthusiasm mind which tries to figure out the main point inside our observed things and being to establish a hypothesis which would be universal truth.</p>

<p>If we think about the first concept that I mentioned in the first point which was about hypothetical thoughts, we can get an interesting idea from here but before going further, we need to know what is hypothetical thoughts? Hypothetical thoughts involve imagining possibilities and mentally exploring their consequences through a process of mental simulation\(^{1}\). I hope reader has understood the core concept of hypothetical thoughts. If so, then we can go further in details about our decision making and establishing any hypothesis process.</p>
    <p>To establish a hypothesis, a human being observes an incident very attentively. First time, he can't separate or grab anything, but when the incident again happens, he tries to figure out the common things or mechanisms that happened previously in front of him. After that, he separates those common similarities or mechanisms from those incidents that observed by him. Then he can find out something that are connected strongly with those incidents. So, there is a greatest possibility to happen those incidents or, more precisely to say, those common stuff that he separated before.
<br><br>
At the very beginning, I mentioned that hypothesis would be a universal law, which would be applicable for anything for where the origin of the law meets and connected. Similar stuff can be seen also for the lower animals, every time they are fighting to live and surviving in this world, and philosophy is operating them, teaching them.
