          <u><h3>Linux Commands</h3></u>
<p>When I come to realize that Windows is not for me, windows is such a bullshit OS, then I focused on Linux. Why linux? Well, its very simple, it allows you to take full 
control over your machine or computer. Actually its very fast and lightweight. It will also allow you to make changes whatever you want from your computer or 
machine which means it is customizable as well as secured than other OS. I know MacOS provides you world class UX as well as security. But who can bear those expenses? 
And for the Windows, its very risky to use while multiple malware attacks and make your machine very slow. Now most important thing is, Linux is fully open source. 
Its completely free for everyone. It has many tastes and distros. You can choice any of them according to your tastes. Actually Linux is for those people who want full 
control over their machine, OS as well as everything while MacOS and Windows don't allow you to do that so. They are very limited to provide you such a kind of opportunity. 
Besides, if you are Mathematics, Computer Science and Logical thoughts enthusiasts, then Linux is for you as I think! Because if you study on CS or Maths, you must have to 
know to operate Linux! Linux will give you a great power and make you generous since you are become used to in a Open Source softwares and packages. You will feel 
something to do for general people (its completely my personal opinion btw :")). Windows doesn't run on older archietecture based computer while only Linux can run. Learning 
Linux allows you to know about Computer Archietecture and how Computer actually works behind. Now, I am going to provide some Linux based bash commands that I learnt up to this day according
    to their usage in different ways and I made them as categorized-</p>

<p class="point"><code>as -32 filename.s -o filename.out</code> - The command <code>as -32 filename.s -o filename.out</code> uses the <code>GNU Assembler</code> to translate the assembly code in <code>filename.s</code> into a <code>32-bit</code> object file named <code>filename.out</code>.</p>
<p class="point"><code>ld -m elf_i386 -s filename.out -o exit</code>s used by the <code>GNU</code> Linker to combine compiled object files into a <code>32-bit ELF</code> executable while stripping the symbol and debugging information to reduce the file size.</p>
<p class="point"><code>as -32 filename.s -o filename.out</code> - Create <code>assembly</code> formated code from <code>C</code> language and make executable by <code>./filename.s</code>.</p>
<p class="point"><code>objdump</code> - It is a command-line utility that is part of the <code>GNU Binutils</code> (Binary Utilities) suite, primarily used to display various information about object files, executable files, and libraries.</p>
<p class="point"><code>objdump -x filename</code> - It works after compiling <code>C</code> code by displaying a comprehensive, verbose view of the entire structure and contents of the resulting executable file. The <code>-x</code> flag is a shorthand for displaying the file's entire header contents.</p>
<p class="point"><code>gcc -S filename.c</code> - You will be able to create <code>assembly</code> file of your <code>C</code> code by using this command.</p>
<br>
<u><h3>Networking & Internet</h3></u>
<br>

<p class="point"><code>nmcli r wifi on</code> - For turning on the WiFi.</p>
<p class="point"><code>nmcli d wifi list</code> - Viewing available wifi list.</p>

<p class="point"><code>lynx/w3m</code> – Terminal web browsers (install required).</p>
<p class="point"><code>lynx www.example.com</code> – Visit a website in terminal.</p>

<p class="point"><code>fast</code> - Let you know your internet speed.</p>
<p class="point"><code>wget &lt;link&gt;</code> - Can download something from terminal.</p>
<p class="point"><code>ddgr &lt;keyword&gt;</code> - Search something from your terminal by <code>DuckDuck</code> Go search engine known as most secured engines. <code>sudo apt install ddgr</code> to install.</p>
<p class="point"><code>wikit</code> - A terminal based wikipedia accessor. <code>wikit "&lt;keyword&gt;".</code> Firstly required <code>sudo apt install nodejs npm</code> and then <code>sudo npm install wikit -g</code>.</p>
<p class="point"><code>Ollama</code> - A free, open-source tool that simplifies running large language models <code>(LLMs)</code> like <code>Llama 3</code> or <code>Mixtral</code> directly on your local computer (Mac, Windows, Linux).
Can be installed <code>curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh</code> and then pull a model like <code>llama3</code> using <code>ollama pull llama3</code> or any model. Can be used <code>ollama run llama3</code> to run from the terminal. To use ollama, 
you need to use <code>ollama run llama3</code> everytime.
So this will load <code>Ollama</code> model everytime. To make <code>Ollama</code> accessible from terminal everytime, it needs to run some commands to permanently setup so that user can run anytime rather than loading whole model everytime and killing time.
Firstly, <code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</code> tells the systemd manager to reread its configuration, rerun generators, reload all unit files (like service definitions), and rebuild the dependency tree, which is crucial after changing unit files or 
adding new services to apply those changes without a full system reboot. It's like a refresh button for systemd's understanding of your services and system setup. <code>sudo systemctl enable ollama</code> makes the <code>Ollama</code> application start 
automatically every time your Linux system boots up, running it as a background service (<code>daemon</code>) so it's always available for serving large language models (<code>LLMs</code>) without needing manual startup or login, unlike just running 
<code>ollama serve</code> which stops when you log out. It uses <code>systemd</code>, the standard Linux service manager, to control the <code>ollama.service</code> file. Now enable the service <code>sudo systemctl enable ollama</code>. Then restart the Unit 
<code>status.service</code> <code>sudo systemctl restart ollama</code>. Now view service if enabled or not <code>sudo systemctl status ollama</code>. To check from browser, use <code>ollama serve</code> to get <code>http://localhost:11434</code> which is basically used
for different purpose, this <code>REST API</code> access models via <code>http://localhost:11434</code>. You can send requests to this <code>API</code> from <code>Python</code> scripts or other applications without starting a new <code>ollama</code> run command for each interaction.
However,now we're ready to use <code>ollama run llama3</code> which doesn't require to load the model everytime instead of setting up permanently to the local macine. <code><i>[Information used here taken from Google Search Results and Ollama Documentation]</i></code></p>
<p class="point"><code>nslookup &lt;domain name&gt;</code> - It is a program to query Internet domain name servers interactively.</p>

       <code><a href="https://whois.networksolutions.com" target="_blank">whois.networksolutions.com</a></code> for <code>NIC</code> handles or <code><a href="https://whois.arin.net">whois.arin.net</a></code> for <code>IPv4</code>

<u><b>Any issues for pushing existing repository</b></u>
<p class="point"><code>git pull origin main</code> - The Standard Way (Merge) and this is the safest way to bring the remote changes into the local branch.</p>
<p class="point"><code>git pull --rebase origin main</code> - The Clean Way (Rebase). If you want to keep a straight project history without "merge commits".</p>
<p class="point"><code>git fetch origin</code> - Downloads the new data, but doesn't change your code. Then</p>
<p class="point"><code>git rebase origin main</code> - Taking the local work and move it on top of the main branch on the origin server. Then it should work 
  <code>git push origin main</code>.</p>
