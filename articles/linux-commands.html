          <u><h3>Linux Commands</h3></u>
    <body>
<p>When I come to realize that Windows is not for me, windows is such a bullshit OS, then I focused on Linux. Why linux? Well, its very simple, it allows you to take full 
control over your machine or computer. Actually its very fast and lightweight. It will also allow you to make changes whatever you want from your computer or 
machine which means it is customizable as well as secured than other OS. I know MacOS provides you world class UX as well as security. But who can bear those expenses? 
And for the Windows, its very risky to use while multiple malware attacks and make your machine very slow. Now most important thing is, Linux is fully open source. 
Its completely free for everyone. It has many tastes and distros. You can choice any of them according to your tastes. Actually Linux is for those people who want full 
control over their machine, OS as well as everything while MacOS and Windows don't allow you to do that so. They are very limited to provide you such a kind of opportunity. 
Besides, if you are Mathematics, Computer Science and Logical thoughts enthusiasts, then Linux is for you as I think! Because if you study on CS or Maths, you must have to 
know to operate Linux! Linux will give you a great power and make you generous since you are become used to in a Open Source softwares and packages. You will feel 
something to do for general people (its completely my personal opinion btw :")). Windows doesn't run on older archietecture based computer while only Linux can run. Learning 
Linux allows you to know about Computer Archietecture and how Computer actually works behind. Now, I am going to provide some Linux based bash commands that I learnt up to this day according
    to their usage in different ways and I made them as categorized-</p>
